# 42_config
Backup configuration used in school

## Install
    cd $HOME
    git clone https://github.com/geam/42_config .dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    ./install.sh

The install script support some options, run `./install.sh -h` to know more

## Update 14-04-2015
I screw up pretty big today on the master branch so you will need to delete $HOME/.dotfiles and reclone it. My bad
